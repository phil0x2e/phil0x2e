- 👋 Hi, I’m phil0x2e or Phil
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in the languages Rust 🦀 and Python 🐍 and in the OS GNU/Linux 🐧
  - I also have lots of experience in Java ☕ from my job as a Software Engineer and used C/C++ in the code I wrote for my Bachelor thesis
- I also like to tinker in many other languages, from functional to OOP

Check out my [procStop project](https://github.com/phil0x2e/procStop), which is currently my largest public project.
It is a physical computing project of mine and aims to provide the software and instructions to create a hardware checkbox tool for your daily tasks using a Raspberry Pi.

You may also check out my small [prgrs](https://github.com/phil0x2e/prgrs) rust library, which is available via [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/prgrs).
It aims to provide an easy way to display progress bars in Rust programs.

[FotoSort-rs](https://github.com/phil0x2e/FotoSort-rs) is a small utility to sort your photos into different folders while previewing them.
